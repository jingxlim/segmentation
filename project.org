* Thesis project
- Misha thinks that the dorsal raphe nucleus stores the motor memory trace so the idea is to shut down the whole brain EXCEPT the dorsal raphe nucleus to see if we can find the memory trace there. If the ramping up activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus goes down immediately, then it is likely that the memory trace is stored somewhere else. If the dorsal raphe nucleus activity lingers on and still spots a decaying activity, which is the stereotyped activity without any shutting down, then we can begin to think of the memory trace as being internally represented in this brain structure.
- There are three stages to this project:
  1) Technical demonstration that the optogentics and calcium indicator set up works and is able to carry out the above investigation.
  2) Look at the resultant dorsal nucleus activity to see if we can find the memory trace there -- as above.
  3) Find out if the resultant activity is due to a single neuron computation or a network computation. The experiment here is to inactivate half the neurons. If the non-inactivated neurons respond in the same way as before, then this suggest that this might be more of a single neuron computation. If the non-activated neurons respond in a different way, or in a way that suggests that it no longer represents the memory trace, then perhaps the network supports this computation.
* Rotation project (8 weeks)
1. Get used to the behaviour paradigm
2. Check the DRN line for channelrhopsin expression
3. Check what the phenotype is when DRN is optogenetically stimulated

- GFP and many of the other naturally-occuring biosensors are kind of slow -- about 300 ms.
- Whole brain imaging of voltage sensors is done at 300 Hz, which means that the sampling is done every 3.3 ms.
- When sampling at such high speeds, another concern is the level of fluoresence. Because sampling is done so quicky, the exposure time is short and therefore the samples don't quite light up as much.
- Therefore, better biosensors that perform better on the time resolution must be used.
- The current voltage sensor that Takashi is testing is very fast ~30 ms.
* 17JUN20 Performed the whole fictive behaviour experiment on my own and learnt how to make experimental notes
** Making experimental notes
- Date of experiment
- Task structure: basically the experimental paradigm (e.g. 20s switch between low and high gain)
- Age of fish
- Gain: setting in the software
- Adaptation
- Behaviour: Is the swim good?
** Lab outing: hike at Great Falls
* 17JUN21 Practiced the fictive behaviour experiment
** Practiced pulling the pipette, zebrafish paralysis and recording fictive behaviour
- Was able to record fictive behaviour in electrode 1 and not so successfully in electrode 2 -- unclear bouts.
** Director's welcome dinner at Gerry Rubin's place
* 17JUN22 Practiced the fictive behaviour experiment
** Got Takashi to fix the loose micromanipulator
** Practiced pulling the pipette, zebrafish paralysis and recording fictive behaviour
- Worked with 3-4 fishes, but wasn't successful in completely recording the fictive behaviour.
- Was able to observe swim bouts in one of the electrodes for two out of the four attempts.
- Electrode 2 seems to be the problem -- have not successfully recorded from it yet.
** Misha meeting: discussed project again
- Told Misha about Takashi's plan for me
- Misha to implement two slots a day on the light sheet microscope
- Misha explained the light field microscope to me
- Misha explained how we could use the new optogenetics-enabled transgenic line by a clever trick: subtracting signals from different channels and with/out the DMD
** CANCELED Think about project ideas using the DMD

** Couldn't find Anaconda prompt or Anaconda navigator
** Reinstalled Anaconda to find that Anaconda wasn't properly added to the menu
** Some people complained that Windows only allowed path variables up to 1024 characters
- This wasn't my problem because I wasn't even trying to add to the PATH
- However, this might be a problem for the creation of desktop and start menu shortcuts
** Reinstalled Anaconda to C:\Anaconda3\ instead of C:\Users\JingXuan\Anaconda3\
- Despite this, still cannot install, probably Avast blocking its action, thinking that it's an IDP attack...
- Realised that this was a problem that I also encountered earlier
** Reinstalled Anaconda but with Avast disabled and succeeded: Anaconda shortcuts are now in the start menu (but not on the desktop)
- Forgetting about the Desktop
** Should I still stick to Emacs for C# programming? No, use Visual Studio IDE.
- Emacs + Omnisharp is the way to go for programming C# on Eamcs. Any other setup probably requires a lot more time and effort to setup.
- Even with Omnisharp, Emacs still lacks in functionality when compared to Visual Studio IDE. Visual Studio IDE, while being a general Windows IDE, has many functions just made for C#. Emacs doesn't carry those functions.
- Visual Studio Code is still far away in functionality when compared to Visual Studio IDE. Use Visual Studio IDE.
- The remaining question now is if I have access to the Professional and Enterprise versions. If not the free Community version seems fine. I should also check with the rest of the group what version they use.
** DONE Get the denoising script for Takashi

** Lab meeting: glia + giving up
- kosher is better at passing calcium, but don't know about channelrhodopsin.
- antidepressants improve the performance of the forced swim test; so this is required as a screen for new antidepressent drugs.
- want to use 'giving up' because the other terms are loaded in the literature and so have to prove it is the same.
- can try using SSRIs, TK tried and fish swam less.
- there are strain to strain variability in the forced swim test.
- might have to redo the factorisation because the task structure were all different, and the factorisation is derived from the whole time series.
- the factorisation might be a bit noisier because the time series is shorter (if remove unrelated task structures).
- think that glia is driving neural activity after giving up.
- suspect that glial cell activity onset can predict better giving up than amplitude of these events.
- want to establish causality between neuronal and glia activity. we think that neuronal activity is generated from rhythmic activity in glial.
- should subtract the motor component, which happens in both swim and no swim.
- you want to deconvolve neurons and not glial; indirect measure in neurons and direct measure in glial
- if you think the rise time is independent of the decay, then you have to put them independently in the model.
- want to deconvolve the waist with something above to get a smaller bump in the neuron activity.
