#+STARTUP: entitiespretty

* old 2-photon procedure
1. Start ephys recording
2. Start writing
3. Start imaging
4. Stop imaging
5. Stop ephys recording
** Notes
- If you stop ephys recoding before stopping writing, your ephys file won't be saved (?!, see below)
- If you stop writing before stopping ephys recording, your ephys file won't be saved (?!, see above)
* data analysis procedure
1. Good to restart the kernel before rerunning analyses
2. Update date_dir and fnames
3. Set ~cthresh~ and ~cmax~ to remove noise and to visualize better respectively
4. Remove blank frames at the front and at the back of the stack

- remind misha to make stimulus box unresizeable
- it is nice to see a response to the swim bouts but i'm surprised the cells are not really active during the intervals. do zebrafishes only think about swimming?

** Analysis notes
- The waist area is oscillates 46 times in 66.7 seconds == 0.7 Hz
- Start of swim bouts seem to happen at a particular time during an oscillatory wave
- Seems like there could be some phase precession?
- The ends of the waist (what's their name?) also seem to be oscillating at similar frequencies, and swim bouts are time locked to the oscillations at those frequencies. However, they also appear to be oscillating at a slower frequency of maybe 0.04 Hz, which might have nested some of the smaller but faster oscillations, which might have made some of the time-locking events harder to spot.

- mode: gratings
- set 1: gain 0 vel 0 time 20
- set 2: gain 0 vel 0.5 time 20
- see 1 Hz oscilations in the axon bundles of the waist area
- heart rate is slightly higher than 1 Hz (~1.5 Hz)
** Analysis notes
- Again, swim bouts seem to be time-locked to the oscillations.
- The top most part of the waist seems to have the largest oscillations.
- The regions beneath the waist regions are not oscillating.

- big group of cells in the top right of the waist area
- oscillations not obvious (due to differnet stimulus?)
** Analysis notes
- Oscillations are not as obvious even in the waist region. 
- The swim bouts are also not as strong and so it's hard to say when the fish is swimming too.

- mode: gratings

- oscillations not immediately obvious now
- heartbeat is also weakened
** Analysis notes
- Possibly slower oscillations in the waist area. 
- The swims are very weak and few so it's difficult to determine where they are and if they are actually time-locked.

** Analysis notes
- The cerebellum is not silent at all! Might be the bad alignment causing very little fluorophores to be activated in the previous data so the dynamics wasn't clear.
- The cerebellum doesn't really oscillate. It is also not anti-correlated with the swim bouts. Their activity just seems to be early-shifted with respect to the swim bouts. It seems like it's active before swims.
- During long swim bouts, cerebellar activity overlaps with swim starts, suggesting that cerebellar activity doesn't inhibit swims.
* 17JUL09: fish-2_osc-11
- imaged in the mid part of the right cerebellum.
- swims alot less when in the grating mode than during the texture mode -- stronger perception of gestalt (maybe not the correct word because the organized parts are not interspersed with chaotic parts).

- big bouts of swimming not necessarily when vel = 1.0, but also during vel = 0
- Stopped writing before turning off the imaging... the last imaging frame might be no more...
** Analysis notes
- Oscillations are not as obvious than in previous recordings. Might be difficult to tell because I recorded both sides of the brain at the same resolution 100 x 1500 so I might be losing a lot of information.
- Time-locking of swim bouts to calcium signal might still be evident in the middle traces...
